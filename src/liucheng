create database yhn;
use yhn;

1. 建表

create table student(
    sno int  ,
    sname varchar  ,
    age int  ,
    school varchar,
    home varchar not null,
    primary key ( sno  ,   sname   ),
    foreign key (name) references test(name),
    unique key (school)
);

2. 插入
insert into student values(2011,张三,18,school3,shandong1);
insert into student (sname,home) value(张三,山东);     # 报错
insert into student (sno,sname,home) value(2011,张三,山东);   # 报错 字段不能为空
insert into student values(2011,张三,18,school3,shandong1);  # 报错主键重复
insert into student values(2012,张三1,19,school1,shandong6);
insert into student values(2013,张三2,15,school99,shandong3);
insert into student values(2014,张三3,12,school1,shandong2);

3. 删除
delete from student;
delete from student where sno = 2011;

4. 查询
select sno, sname from student order by sno desc;
select sno,sname from student;
select * from student;
select * from student where sno >= 2012 and sno = 2013 or sno = 2014;
select * from student where sno >= 2012 and school != school99;

5.更新
update student set sno = 9999, school= 测试学校 where sno = 2012;
update student set sno = 2014, sname = 张三3 where sno = 2012;  #报错 主键重复


create view aaa  as select * from student;
